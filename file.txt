<h1> Troubleshooting Diverging Branches Error messages
<h1>

<p>  
It finally worked! I messed up my original push/pull/local to git sync by creating a Read Me File in Github.
Seems by doing this, I created a conflict. 

The terminal kept pulling up a messages re: two branches causing conflict. 

Then I attempted using the commands to merge histories --allow-unrelated-histories. 

Terminal then pulled up a message requesting me to add message before commiting, but then I seemed stuck in a loop.
Couldn't close out of the 'message' state in the terminal, so after some Googling, was able to figure out that
I could 'control Z' on Mac terminal and return to command line. 

Once on the command line kept attempting 'git merge' 'git pull' 'git push', kept returning error messaging regarding that there
was a merge in process. 

Somehow was able to decipher from the messaging that I needed to go back to VS Studio and accept the commit, which 
was what was causing ANOTHER error re: a 'swap' file (I think because I closed out of the 'message'state in the terminal?)

LOL. I am very glad I did not give up - even though initially receiving that first message 5 min. into the course video was
a little disheartening. Good to know/good excersise to just keep reading the terminal error messages, and use the 
online message boards to troubleshoot. Seems I am not good to go/connected ðŸŽ‰
